# Recursive-Descent-Game
Final project for programming languages class created in a group consisting of Kyle Culley, Tom Sullivan, and Tristan Silerio. 

This game runs using the 'Recursive_Descent.rb' file and will require Ruby gem, Ruby2d, as the GUI.
Every other file in this repo are the part of the graphics and audio of the game. 

To run the game, type 'ruby Recursive_Descent.rb' in the console to execute it. Enjoy!
