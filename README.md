# Recursive-Descent-Game
Final project for programming languages class created in a group consisting of Kyle Culley, Tom Sullivan, and Tristan Silerio. 

This game runs using the 'Recursive_Descent.rb' file and will require Ruby gem, Ruby2d, as the GUI.
Every other file in this repo are the part of the graphics and audio of the game. Enjoy!
